# Weather-dashboard

## Description
In this project I was tasked to create a weather dashboard which would show users the current weather along with a 5 day forecast. There were a lot of different parts that went into the project which all worked together to make this work. This project was very tough and I had to do a lot of research to make the application work. Through this project I learned a lot things such as implementing 3rd party APIs, learning the BULMA css framework, and getting a better understanding in how to better use functions to do harder tasks.

## Usage
When the user first opens the webpage, they will be asked to allow or block the use of their current location. If allowed, the webpage will pull up the current weather and a 5 day forecast for the user's location. If the user blocks the use of their location or it is unable to be used, it will automatically pull up the weather for New York.
